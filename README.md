## Session Steps & Instructions  
  
### 1. **Check-in & Recap** (5 min)  
- Welcome and attendance.  
- Review: What regularization and stability methods have we tried so far?  
- Introduce today's focus: Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) and Gradient Clipping.  
  
---  
  
### 2. **Guided Example: BatchNorm & Gradient Clipping** (25 min)  
  
**Concepts Introduction** (5 min)  
- **Batch Normalization:** Stabilizes and accelerates training by normalizing layer inputs.  
- **Gradient Clipping:** Prevents exploding gradients by capping their magnitude during backpropagation.  
- Discuss: Where do these fit in the regularization/stability toolkit?  
  
**Live Coding Demo** (20 min)  
  
- Compare a simple network vs. the same network with BatchNorm and gradient clipping.  
- Train on a subset of CIFAR-10 (for speed).  
- Visualize training/validation curves and gradient norms.  
  
---  
  
### 3. **Solo Exercise: Build Your Advanced Toolkit** (25 min)  
  
- Students work on a scaffolded script using Fashion-MNIST.  
- Tasks:  
    - Add BatchNorm layers to a multi-layer network.  
    - Implement gradient clipping in the training loop.  
    - Compare baseline vs. regularized model performance.  
    - Plot and analyze training curves and gradient statistics.

### 4. **Review & Preview** (5 min)  
  
- Share: What changes did you see in training curves and gradients?  
- Key takeaways: Effects of BatchNorm and gradient clipping.  
- Next session preview: Combining regularization methods and advanced diagnostics.

## **Session Learning Goals**  
  
By the end of this session, students should:  
1. Understand the purpose and impact of BatchNorm and gradient clipping.  
2. Know how to implement both techniques in PyTorch.  
3. Analyze their effects on training dynamics and stability.  
4. Extend their regularization toolkit for future projects.
